## An encode and decode site

Hello stranger!  
This site is a clone of base64decode.
This is intended to be used as a serverless, one paged site, based on ReactJS.
There's nothing fancy here to be honest, just did it out of boredom and the will to fiddle around with ReactJS


### Features:
- URL encode / decode
- Base64 encode / decode
- JavaScript code minification / beautification
- JSON data minification / beautification
- CSS sheet minification / beautification
